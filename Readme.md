Instructions for use:
Place all files/folders in your home  directory

In Windows this is typically C:\Users\username
On Linux this is typically /home/username/

remove the .readme files from XBLA and XBLA_Unpacked

place an XBLA rar archive in the XBLA folder and run the extract.py script. (Note, if the archive is not the name of the game then change it before running the script.)

When wxPirs launches, click the fodler icon, navigate to the innermost folder in XBLA_Unpacked, and select the only file there. Then click the disk icon/extract and leave it defaulting to the innermost subdirectory.
Once that is done close wxPirs and hit enter inside your terminal

You should now have an unarchived folder with the same name in the XBLA_Unpacked directory. inside that folder should be all of the extracted XBLA files including the newly named .xex that is needed to run the game.
