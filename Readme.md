Instructions for use:
Place the XBLA and XBLA_Unpacked folders into your home directory.
remove the .readme files from both folders.
place an XBLA rar archive in the XBLA folder and run the extract.py script. (Note, if the archive is not the name of the game then change it before running the script.)
You should now have an unarchived folder with the same name in the XBLA_Unpacked directory. Each subdirectory in that folder should also now be named the same as the original archived file's name.
