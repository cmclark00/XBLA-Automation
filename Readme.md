Instructions for use:

Make sure you have the newest version of python installed.

In the comand line install patool using "pip install patool".

Download the zipped project file and extract all of its contents to your home directory.
In Windows this is usually C:\Users\username.
In Linux this is usually /home/username.

Place all of your archived XBLA games in the XBLA folder.
If the archive name doesn't match the title of the game then fix that now.

Open a command line in your home directory and run "python extract.py"

Keep an eye on the terminal, eventually it will ask you to hit enter to launch wxPirs.
Select the innermost file in the game directory by clicking the open button and navigating to it, then click the save/extract button.
Once it is done extracting all of the files close wxPirs and then hit enter in the command line window.

Repeat the last step until you have gone through all of your archives. You will know the program has ended when it shows your home directory as the final location in the terminal.

Special note for Linux users, you will have to use wine to run wxPirs. Once you set that up it should run fine.
